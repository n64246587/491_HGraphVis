This is the repository for the research project I undertook.
My apologies that it is a bit messy at the moment.

This is an indevelopment hypergraph visualizer made public at the request of my research advisor.
The main file is input.jl which can run to start the command line hypergraph visualizer. 
Starting the program will automatically invoke the help command so that you will know what commands are valid and what the syntax for it is.

The first time the program is started in a session, the packages will likely take a while (~30 seconds) to load. Please take that time to read the output of the help command.
